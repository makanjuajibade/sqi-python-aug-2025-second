# ================================
# Exercise: Divide Numbers Safely
# ================================
#
# Write a program with the following requirements:
#
# 1. Define a function called `safe_divide(a, b)` that:
#    - Takes two numbers as input.
#    - Returns the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
#    - Raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `b` is zero.
#    - Raises a `TypeError` if either `a` or `b` is not a number.
#

def safe_divide(a: int, b: int):
    try:
        result = int(a) / int(b)
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        return f"Cannot divide by zero: {e}"
    except TypeError as e:
        return f"a and b must be integers: {e}"
    except ValueError as e:
        return f"a and b must be integers: {e}"
    else:
        return result
    finally:
        print("This will always run")
    

# 2. In the main part of the program:
#    - Ask the user to enter two values (numerator and denominator).
#    - Use a try/except block to:
#        a) Handle division by zero.
#        b) Handle non-numeric inputs.
#    - Keep asking until the user provides valid numeric input and the division works.
#    - When successful, print the result and exit.
#

numerator = input("Enter the numerator: ")
denominator = input("Enter the denominator: ")

print(safe_divide("4", 5))

# ==========================================
# Sample Input and Output (user interaction)
# ==========================================
#
# Input: 10, 0
# Output: Cannot divide by zero.
#
# Input: ten, 2
# Output: Both inputs must be numbers.
#
# Input: 15, 3
# Output: 15 divided by 3 is 5.0
#
# ==========================================
# Your task:
# - Implement the `safe_divide` function with proper exception handling.
# - Use the function inside a loop until the user gives valid input.



# ================================
# Exercise: Convert Temperature
# ================================
#
# Write a program with the following requirements:
#
# 1. Define a function called `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)` that:
#    - Takes a number as input.
#    - Returns the temperature converted to Fahrenheit. fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
#    - Raises a `ValueError` if the input is not convertible to a number.
#

# def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
#     return (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# 2. In the main part of the program:
#    - Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius.
#    - Use a try/except block to:
#        a) Handle non-numeric inputs.
#    - Keep asking until the user provides valid numeric input.
#    - When successful, print the Fahrenheit equivalent and exit.
#


# while True:
#     try:
#         celsius = float(input("Enter the temperature in celsius: "))
#     except ValueError as e:
#         print("The temperature must be a number", e)
#     else:
#         print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius))
#         break


# ==========================================
# Sample Input and Output (user interaction)
# ==========================================
#
# Input: cold
# Output: Temperature must be a number.
#
# Input: 37
# Output: 37째C is 98.6째F
#
# Input: -40
# Output: -40째C is -40.0째F
#
# ==========================================
# Your task:
# - Implement the `celsius_to_fahrenheit` function with exception handling.
# - Use the function inside a loop until the user gives valid input.
